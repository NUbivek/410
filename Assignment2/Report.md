## Introduction:

This report explains the regression models for the home sale price of a defined sample population of houses using the housing data of Ames population from 2,930 observations between the year 2006 and 2010. There are a total of 82 variables – including 20 continuous, 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, and 14 discrete – involved in this study. For the purpose of this study I have limited the sample population to small family houses -- eliminating apartment complex, warehouses, and condominiums data.

Upon limiting the target sample population to the “typical” family houses, I split the dataset into two parts – train and test. I used 70% of sample data to train and 30% of sample data to test. After the train/test exercise, I used the automated variable selection techniques such as: Adjusted R-square, MaxR, Mallow’s Cp, forward, stepwise, and backward selection techniques, to test and compare the models’ attributes and performance based on different sets of variables. After selecting the variables, I computed the R-square, AIC, BIC, MSE, and MAE to determine which of the models fit the in-sample and out-of-sample data best. Finally, I assigned a grading matrix to grade the predictive accuracy of the models and determine material significance.

Sample population:

The sample population for this study includes all small family houses that were built after year 1950, have a basement, have a gross living area square foot less than 800 sq. ft., consist of a paved driveway, doesn’t have a swimming pool, doesn’t have an irregular lot shape, are under a “normal” sale condition, and contain all public utilities. These features were defined for the purpose of this study to fit the requirement of a “typical” sample. This exercise aims to deduce the price of the type of house defined above, and were, hence, not included in the sample. I used the waterfall method in SAS to narrow down the population data to the given “typical” data set. The data output with excluded rows are presented below in Table 1 using waterfall technique in SAS. The waterfall exercise dropped my sample size to 1431 houses from the original pool of 2,930 observations. Meaning, about 45% of the houses did not qualify the “typical” house type required by the study. It is also important to note that SAS dropped 330 houses and named them “Missing” during the course of data. These houses are also not included in the sample data and left out for the purpose of this study as out-of-scope observations.
